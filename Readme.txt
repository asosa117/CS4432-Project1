Section 1: You should just run the code and it should prompt you in the console to input your buffer size then your
commands. All commands follow the project 1 requirements.

Section 2: All test cases work except for "SET 430" because the scanner is still waiting for a string but it is never
getting one. So Please Write each Command Correctly with the proper elements.

Section 3: I created a search for unpinned function that searches the buffer for an unpinned frame.
But every method was created using the project 1 requirements described.
